Scilab module for overloading functions
=======================================

Scilab module for overloading functions when the first input argument
of a function is an object (more precisely an mlist).

Version 1.0 May, 2006
======================

Jean-Francois Magni: jean-francois.magni_at_onera.fr

Short description
=================

Basically

   foo(arg1,arg2,.....)

is replaced automatically by

   %typ_foo(arg1,arg2,.....)

if `arg1` is an `mlist` s.t. `typeof(arg1) = 'typ'` otherwise it is

   %old_foo(arg1,arg2,.....)

which is invoked (`%old_foo` is a copy of the pre-existing function `foo`)

This script creates all the relevant Scilab functions (`foo`, `%old_foo`).
Note that the list of overloaded function can be customized in the
updater.sce file.

This module is a complement to the Symbolic and LFR toolboxes

Installation
============
To Install this toolbox: (Scilab-4.0 or higher)

We Suppose here that <PATH> stands for the path to the directory
containing this README file.

1- Execute only once the following instruction within Scilab:
    `exec <PATH>/updater.sce`
2- Execute only once the following instruction within Scilab:
    `exec <PATH>/builder.sce`
3- Each times Scilab is launched, execute within Scilab:
    exec <PATH>/loader.sce
    It is better to execute loader.sce from the .scilab startup
    file for automatic loading. This file should be in
    `<HOME_DIRECTORY>\Scilab\scilab-x.x` (Windows) or
    `~/.Scilab/scilab-x.x (Unix/Linux)`.
